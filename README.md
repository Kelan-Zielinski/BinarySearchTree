# BinarySearchTree

- IDE: VS Code and Unix
- Programming Language: C++

Problem: We want to be able to create and implement a binary search tree to compare data across text files.

Process:
  - Create a class for BST (header file BST.h)
  - Create BST.cpp file to implement methods to read, modify, and compare text files
